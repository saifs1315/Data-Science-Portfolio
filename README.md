# Portfolio

Hello !

I am a techie currently located in Mumbai. I graduated in 2019 with a B.Tech degree specialising in Electronics and Instrumentation. Despite my formal education having little to no exposure to programming, computers or tech, my curious nature and intrigue has always pushed me to this ever growing space. I have done multiple courses on Machine Learning and Data Analytics using Python and developing web applications using JavaScript to understand the building blocks of today's digital space. Alongside this, I have over 3 years of work experience as an automated quality assurance engineer which has provided me an in-depth exposure to the workings of a fast-paced, agile model of software development and, allowed me to develop intuition to grasp the workings of web applications and decipher complex business requirements to report faults on the application being tested, helping the organisation develop a better quality product for the client. 

This is a Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes. I have used Jupiter Notebooks and Python for these projects.
